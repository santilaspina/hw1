descrizione: BOTTER is back alongside Reebok to once again reimagine the Energia Bo Kèts. This time around, the sleek silhouette emerges in a clean white colorway and a stealthy black look, featuring a synthetic upper and a rubber sole. The sneaker, which draws from Reebok's archival soccer cleats from the 2000s as well as their 90s climbing shoes, is defined by its fold-over tongue, here branded with the iconic Vector logo. The symbol also appears on other areas of the shoe, complemented by BOTTER iconography that signals the collaboration.
